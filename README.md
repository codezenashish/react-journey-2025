# My React Learning Journey

This repository contains a collection of small projects I've built while learning React. Each project is in its own directory and focuses on different concepts and skills.

## Projects

Here's a list of the projects in this repository:

1.  **01-calculator**: A simple calculator application.
2.  **02-card-components**: A project demonstrating the use of card components.
3.  **03-background-changer**: An application that changes the background color.
4.  **04-passwords-gn**: A password generator application.

## Getting Started

To run any of these projects, navigate to the project's directory and follow the instructions in its `README.md` file (if available). Generally, you will need to:

1.  Install dependencies: `npm install`
2.  Start the development server: `npm run dev`

## About Me

I'm currently learning React and building these projects to practice my skills. I'm excited to continue learning and building more complex applications.
